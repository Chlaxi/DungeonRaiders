# DungeonRaiders
A rogue-like turn based RPG, inspired by Darkest Dungeon and The Pathfinder Role Playing Game

The game is currently in a playable demo state, where the player can setup their party, level up their characters and experience combat.

Everything in this game, except from the graphics, are made by me. 

Current features includes:
-Being able to setup your party from a predetermined list of characters.
-By clicking "Embark" you enter a demo level, where you can walk around either by using the A (left) or D (right) key or by clicking or touching the left or right side of the screen.
To enter a combat encounter, click the button in the top right corner. Combat is turn based, and the initiative order is determined at the beginning of combat. Your current character will be chosen automatically. Clicking any of your abilities, allows you to read more info about it, as well as see who you can target with the ability. After an ablity is chosen, you can click on a valid target to use it, and the turn order progresses.

The game currently runs on premade characters with predetermined weapons and abilities, but customisation will be added soon.


Todo list:
-Add more classes
-Add more spells
-Better defined classes, both visually and through talent trees (statistics) 
-Add character customisation, so you can change the appearance, gear, and setup spells before embarking.
-Automatically start encounters*
-Procedurally generate dungeons (* encounters triggers will be implemented here)
-Better UI Graphics
-Better game assets (graphics)
-World map, which allows you to choose which adventure to go on, which will feature different challenges and monsters.
